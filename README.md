# Operation: René

## Overview
The game revolves around a *nerd* called ***Hunter*** which guides a *robber* called ***René***, who must rob a building of interest at each level, such as a bank or a museum.

## Characters
One Player embodies the nerd, which has a .pdf manual with all the instructions to defuse alarms, avoid lasers and planimetries of the building.
The other Player embodies the robber, which has to overcome the traps and alarms with help from the nerd. 

## Gameplay
The nerd doesn't know the position of the robbers, neither knows the room the robber is in. The robber can see the rooms and the objects in them.
Robbers have to solve puzzles to deactivate alarms and traps such as:
- Pressure-sensitive plates
- Laser sensors
- Minigames and puzzles to unlocks doors and safes

The Robber has a limited amount of time to achieve the goal and escape the building before the police arrives.
Each error will reduce the the time available for the robber to steal and escape.

## Campaign Mode
The game currently has 3 levels of increasing difficulty. They can be completed in any order

## Random Generation
The rooms are generated in a random way, in order to further increase chaos and unpredictability.
Communication between robbers and nerd is key to complete each level.
