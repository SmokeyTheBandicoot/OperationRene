# René

## Overview
The game revolves around a *nerd* called ***Hunter*** which guides one or two *robbers* called ***René*** and ***Yuri***, who must rob a building of interest at each level, such as a bank or a museum.

## Characters
One Player embodies the nerd, which has a .pdf manual with all the instructions and planimetries.
The other Player(s) embodies the robber(s), which have to overcome the traps and alarms with help from the nerd. 

## Gameplay
The nerd doesn't know the positiaon of the robbers, neither knows the room the robbers are in. The robbers can see the rooms and the objects in them as soon as they enter it.
Robbers have to solve puzzles to deactivate alarms and traps such as:
- Security Cameras
- Pressure-sensitive plates
- Laser sensors
- Guards
- Combinations for doors and safes
- Locks (both traditional and magnetic keys)

Robbers have a limited amount of time to achieve the goal and escape the building before the police arrives.

## Technical aspects
The rooms are generated in a procedural way, in order to further increase chaos and unpredictability.
Communication between robbers and nerd is key to complete each level.

## Players & Multiplayer
The canonical way to play the game is 2-3 players, in which one embodies the nerd and the others embody the robbers, but this is not the only mode:
- Single Player: The Computer emulates the nerd, removing the need of having a second player which reads the manual.
- 2-Players: Offline manual for Player 1, Local application for Player 2. No networking involved.
- 3-Players: Offline manual for Player 1, Player 2 and Player 3 play in the same room in a private lobby through networking.
